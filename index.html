              My wife Rachel and I currently live in Lewiston, Idaho with our two dogs. One is a 
              pug, Henry, and the other dog, Ripley, is a miniature schnauzer. 
              My current job is at Vista Outdoors, where I am a millwright in a factory that makes explosives(primers) 
              for bullets. I enjoy my job there because I like the troubleshooting aspect of 
              my work, and I get to play with robots all day. In my spare time I work with my wife on our 
              freelance business, CodePug Creative, and she teaches me how to be better at design.
          </p>
          <p>
              I like to do many things outside of work. Rachel and I look forward to fishing each 
              spring which I enjoy, despite not being very good at it. We both like to get out 
              and take the dogs on walks or play a round of frisbee golf in the park. I also 
              like to plink around on my guitar or play with my electronic music equipment if 
              I get bored.
          </p>

              I grew up in Lewiston Idaho, but spent my teen years in Belgium. I learned how to speak some 
              Dutch, and I learned how to eat delicious chocolates really well. Living overseas taught me to 
              appreciate other cultures and I hope to visit there again someday.
          </p>

              I decided to pursue web development after I had received my Communications Degree. 
              Computers have always interested me, and I really enjoy learning anything 
              development related. I am a fast learner, which is why I love web development, 
              there is always something new to learn.
