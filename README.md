# daves-portfolio
I originally made my portfolio in Grav CMS with Gantry framework.  I wanted more flexibility with the design and a lighter server load so I remade it as a static page.

I used Zurb Foundation since it is one of my favorite front end frameworks.  The newest version used here has less styling in the box so that I can customize it the way I want.  The new grid uses flexbox and I like it better than the old float grid.
